Genesis
=======

Genesis is a shoot'em up game (side-scrolling) designed to teach the 
basics of python, programming, and game design.

The art of the game was shamelessly stolen from the Internet, and were 
sitting around my disk for a while. As such, I don't have a clue where 
I found, or who created them. I'll do my best to find the authors and 
give proper credits. They do really deserve it.


Development
-----------

This project uses Python 3.5+ with pygame and Pillow packages.

There are two goals for this project, create an engine than can be
used to create games using a DSL, and experiment with some Python
features to get a better understanding of the inner workings of the
language and what can be done with that.

Unfortunatelly, being the most optimized or clean code is not a goal.
